# Acknowledgment and Notes
We adapted the source code for this slide deck from an example template from https://github.com/gnab/remark.

This slide deck was written in HTML.

The slides themselves were written in Markdown incorporated into the HTML file.

The slides you are seeing are rendered using remark.js <https://remarkjs.com/downloads/remark-latest.min.js>
